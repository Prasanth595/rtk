# rtk-hook-version: 4
# RTK Claude Code hook — rewrites commands to use rtk for token savings.
# Requires: rtk >= 0.23.0, jq
#
# This is a thin delegating hook: all rewrite logic lives in `rtk rewrite`,
# which is the single source of truth (src/discover/registry.rs).
# To add or change rewrite rules, edit the Rust registry — not this file.
#
# Exit code protocol for `rtk rewrite`:
#   0 + stdout  Rewrite found, an allow rule matched → auto-allow
#   1           No RTK equivalent, or an ask rule decided it → pass through unchanged
#   2           Deny rule matched → pass through (Claude Code native deny handles it)
#   3 + stdout  No rule decided an ask, allow short of every command → rewrite but let Claude Code prompt the user

# the command this hook returns, so when one of the user's ask rules decided
# the command, `rtk rewrite` exits 1 and Claude Code prompts on the original
